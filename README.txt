To make the chart look cool:

Explore the BorderSkin properties.
Skinstyle = emboss for rounded edges.
PageColor sets background to match the color of the form if you want.

BackColor and BackGradientStyle creates a gradiant background.

BorderlineColor and BorderlineWidth make a nice touch.

Current config:

Arduino is sampling 100 data points from each axis then averaging them.
Arduino transmits 100ms after acquiring good data.

In my app, I grab serial data every 250ms. and update the GUI/Chart.
